Pointilistic Stochastic Textural Timbre Synthesis is LLM-speak for a granular synthesis engine that presents the user with controls to shape the geometry and composition of a point cloud of grains governed by stochastic probability with a beautiful and responsive interface that provides enough consistency and precision to build the kind of intuition required for confident live performance without hobbling the power of opening the geometry up wide and letting unbridled pseudorandomness flow.
