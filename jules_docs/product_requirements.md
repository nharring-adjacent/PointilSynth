Stochastic Pointillist - Product Requirements Document
1. Product Vision & Mission
Vision: To create a next-generation software instrument that empowers musicians, composers, and sound designers to intuitively sculpt complex, evolving sonic textures using principles of pointillism and stochastic generation.
Mission: To build an inspiring and visually-driven sound generator that abstracts the complexity of granular synthesis into a musically expressive and powerful user experience. We are not building another subtractive synth; we are creating a tool for generating organic, non-linear soundscapes.
2. Target Audience
 * Electronic Music Producers: Seeking unique, atmospheric pads, and complex rhythmic textures that stand out.
 * Film, TV, & Game Composers: Needing a tool for rapid creation of evocative soundscapes, ambient beds, and subtle sonic environments.
 * Sound Designers: Looking for a flexible engine to create novel sound effects and textural elements from any source audio.
 * Experimental Musicians & Academics: Exploring new forms of synthesis and algorithmic composition.
3. Key Features & Epics
This section outlines the high-level features (Epics) and the core user stories that define the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and key V2 extensions.
EPIC 1: Core Sound Engine (MVP)
 * Description: The heart of the instrument is a high-performance granular synthesis engine capable of generating sound from both internal oscillators and user-provided samples.
 * User Stories/Requirements:
   * As a user, I can load a user-owned audio sample (WAV, AIFF) to be used as the grain source.
   * As a user, I can select from a basic set of internal waveforms (Sine, Saw, Square, Noise) to use as the grain source.
   * The engine must support generating up to a target number of simultaneous grains (e.g., 256) with high CPU efficiency.
   * Each grain must have its own distinct properties (pitch, pan, duration, amplitude) assigned at the moment of creation.
   * Each grain must be shaped by a selectable amplitude envelope (e.g., Trapezoid, Hann) to control its attack/decay characteristics.
EPIC 2: Stochastic Parameter Control (MVP)
 * Description: Users control the sound not via fixed values, but by shaping the probability distributions that govern the properties of each generated grain. This is the core "pointillistic" concept.
 * User Stories/Requirements:
   * As a user, I can control the Density of grain generation (events per second).
   * As a user, I can define a central Pitch and a Dispersion amount to control the statistical spread of grain pitches.
   * As a user, I can define an average grain Duration and a Variation amount.
   * As a user, I can control the central stereo Position and the stereo Spread of the sound cloud.
   * As a user, I can select a Temporal Distribution model (e.g., Uniform, Poisson/Random) to change the rhythmic feel of grain generation.
EPIC 3: Interactive User Interface & Visualization (MVP)
 * Description: The UI/UX must be visually compelling and provide immediate, intuitive feedback, encouraging experimentation and making the complex underlying processes understandable.
 * User Stories/Requirements:
   * As a user, I want to see a central, real-time 2D visualization of the generated sound grains.
     * X-axis should represent stereo position (pan).
     * Y-axis should represent pitch.
     * The appearance of a grain (e.g., color, size) should reflect its properties (e.g., source, duration).
   * As a user, I can control the primary stochastic parameters (Density, Pitch, Duration, etc.) via large, clearly labeled, interactive UI controls ("Pods").
   * As a user, I can access a detailed editor for a parameter (e.g., Pitch Dispersion) by clicking on its main control pod.
   * The UI must provide clear visual feedback linking parameter changes to the real-time visualization.
EPIC 4: Modulation System (V2)
 * Description: To create evolving and dynamic textures, the instrument requires a flexible modulation system to animate the core stochastic parameters over time.
 * User Stories/Requirements:
   * As a user, I can utilize multiple LFOs (Low-Frequency Oscillators) with standard shapes (sine, saw, random).
   * As a user, I can utilize multiple ADSR envelopes that can be triggered by MIDI input.
   * As a user, I can easily assign a modulation source (e.g., LFO 1) to a destination parameter (e.g., Pitch Dispersion) via a modulation matrix or drag-and-drop interaction.
   * As a user, I can control the amount of modulation applied for each routing.
EPIC 5: Preset Management (MVP)
 * Description: A robust preset system is critical for user onboarding, inspiration, and workflow efficiency.
 * User Stories/Requirements:
   * As a user, I can save the entire state of the instrument as a preset.
   * As a user, I can load presets from a user-friendly browser.
   * As a user, I can browse factory presets that showcase the instrument's capabilities.
   * The preset browser should support basic tagging and categorization (e.g., "Texture," "Rhythmic," "Melodic," "FX").
4. Non-Functional Requirements
 * Performance: The engine must be highly optimized for real-time performance, with a goal of keeping CPU usage below 15% on a modern reference machine under typical use cases (e.g., 128 grains).
 * Audio Quality: All signal processing, particularly pitch shifting and resampling, must be of professional audio quality, minimizing artifacts.
 * Plugin Formats: The instrument must be delivered as a 64-bit plugin in the following formats: VST3, AU, and AAX.
 * Stability: The plugin must be stable and not introduce crashes within major DAWs (Ableton Live, Logic Pro X, Pro Tools, FL Studio).
 * UI Responsiveness: The UI must remain fluid and responsive (targeting 60 fps) even during high-density sound generation.
