Pointilistic Synth Sprint Plan
### **Sprint 0: Project Foundation & Scaffolding (1 Week)**

This preliminary sprint is executed by senior staff to create a stable and scalable foundation, enabling parallel work for the entire team from Sprint 1 onwards.

* **Primary Goal:** Establish the core project structure, build system, and continuous integration pipeline.
* **Key Activities:**
    * [cite_start]**Project Setup:** Initialize the C++ project using the JUCE framework, configuring it to build VST3, AU, and AAX plugin targets[cite: 41, 48].
    * [cite_start]**Dependency Integration:** Integrate and validate core third-party libraries: Skia for graphics [cite: 60] [cite_start]and nlohmann/json for presets[cite: 68].
    * **Architectural Skeleton:** Define the primary interfaces and data structures. [cite_start]This includes creating placeholder classes for `AudioEngine`, `StochasticModel`, and the `Grain` structure[cite: 13]. This is the most critical step for enabling parallel work.
    * **CI/CD Pipeline:** Configure a continuous integration server to automatically build and run tests on every code submission.
    * **Test Framework:** Set up the unit testing environment.

### **EPIC 1 & 2: Core Sound Engine & Stochastic Controls**

These sprints focus on creating a "headless" version of the instrument. All work can be validated through audio output and unit tests, without requiring a functional UI.

#### ðŸ“¢ **Dependency Deadline: Start of Sprint 1**
* [cite_start]**Sound Design Team:** Provide a small collection of diverse WAV and AIFF files for testing the sample loader[cite: 11].

#### **Sprint 1: Core Grain Generation (2 Weeks)**

* **Primary Goal:** To generate silent "grains" from both internal and external audio sources.
* **Parallel Workstreams:**
    * [cite_start]**Stream A: Sample Loading:** Implement the mechanism to load user-owned WAV and AIFF samples using the JUCE Audio Format Readers[cite: 11, 72]. The output is a class that provides audio data to the rest of the engine.
    * [cite_start]**Stream B: Oscillator Source:** Implement the internal waveform generator, producing basic sine, saw, square, and noise signals that can be used as a grain source[cite: 12].
    * [cite_start]**Stream C: Grain Scheduler:** Develop the high-performance scheduler capable of managing a target of 256 simultaneous grains[cite: 13]. At this stage, it will just instantiate and track grain objects with default properties.

#### **Sprint 2: Stochastic Parameter Logic (2 Weeks)**

* **Primary Goal:** Implement the mathematical models that will control grain properties.
* **Parallel Workstreams:**
    * [cite_start]**Stream A: Pitch & Pan:** Using the C++ `<random>` library, develop the logic to control the central **Pitch** with a statistical **Dispersion** [cite: 18, 57] [cite_start]and the stereo **Position** with a **Spread** amount[cite: 20].
    * [cite_start]**Stream B: Duration & Rhythm:** Implement the controls for average grain **Duration** with **Variation**[cite: 19]. [cite_start]Implement the selectable **Temporal Distribution** models (e.g., Uniform, Poisson) to control the **Density** of grain creation[cite: 17, 21].
    * [cite_start]**Stream C: Grain Enveloping:** Implement the selectable amplitude envelopes (e.g., Hann, Trapezoid) that will shape the attack and decay of each grain[cite: 15].

#### **Sprint 3: Audio Synthesis & Integration (2 Weeks)**

* **Primary Goal:** Combine the sources from Sprint 1 with the logic from Sprint 2 to produce the final audio output.
* **Parallel Workstreams:**
    * [cite_start]**Stream A: Pitch Shifting:** Implement the high-quality resampling algorithm (e.g., Windowed-Sinc) to pitch-shift grains with professional audio quality and minimal artifacts[cite: 40, 54]. This is a critical, focused task.
    * **Stream B: Engine Integration:** Connect the stochastic parameter models (Pitch, Density, etc.) to the grain scheduler and the new resampler. The engine should now produce audible, controllable sound.
    * **Stream C: Test Harness:** Build a simple, internal debugging interface to change parameters at runtime and validate the audio output, ensuring all controls work as expected.

#### **Review Sprint A: Engine Performance & Test Coverage (1 Week)**

* **Primary Goal:** To harden and optimize the core engine.
* **All-Hands Activities:**
    * [cite_start]**Profiling:** rigorously test the engine to ensure CPU usage remains below 15% on a reference machine with a typical load of 128 grains[cite: 39].
    * **Unit Testing:** Write comprehensive tests for all DSP and stochastic components, verifying mathematical correctness and checking for edge cases.
    * **Refactoring:** Optimize code based on profiler results and fix all discovered bugs.

### **EPIC 3 & 5: UI, Visualization & Preset Management**

These sprints run parallel to the engine development, starting after Sprint 0. They rely on the interfaces defined in the scaffolding phase, allowing UI to be built with mock data until final integration.

#### ðŸ“¢ **Dependency Deadline: Start of Sprint 4**
* [cite_start]**UI/UX Design Team:** Deliver final wireframes, high-fidelity mockups of the "Pod" controls, visual asset files (images, icons), and specifications for the real-time visualization's appearance[cite: 23, 25].

#### **Sprint 4: UI Scaffolding & Visualization (3 Weeks)**

* **Primary Goal:** Build the main UI window and the complex real-time visualization.
* **Parallel Workstreams:**
    * **Stream A: UI Layout:** Construct the main plugin window and layout using JUCE components. [cite_start]Create placeholder components for the large interactive "Pods"[cite: 26].
    * **Stream B: Visualization Backend:** Using Skia, implement the rendering canvas. [cite_start]Develop the logic to draw and animate hundreds of grain visuals at a target of 60fps[cite: 42, 60]. [cite_start]This stream will use a *mock data generator* to simulate grain information (pan, pitch, size)[cite: 24].
    * [cite_start]**Stream C: Pod Component v1:** Develop the foundational custom JUCE component for the "Pod" controls, focusing on visual styling and basic interaction without its detailed editor panel yet[cite: 64].

    * [cite_start]**Feedback Loop:** Ensure that changing a parameter on the UI is immediately and accurately reflected in the real-time visualization and the audio output[cite: 28].
    * **Preset Finalization:** Verify that saving and loading presets correctly restores the complete state of both the audio engine and the UI.

#### **Review Sprint B: MVP Stability & Finalization (2 Weeks)**
